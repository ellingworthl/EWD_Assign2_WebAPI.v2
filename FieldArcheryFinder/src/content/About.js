        <h1>More about FAF</h1>
        
        <p>FAF's objective is to help existing and new archers find field archery venues, clubs and their ranges, and be able to share information, useful websites, or comment on an event they have attend.</p>

        <p>Inspiration  for the site came in two waves. The first stems from being new to archery and wanting to find information about a club/shoot venue and then be able to find course on the day of the competition (courses set on woodland can be notoriously difficult to find). The second, a 'shoot review', is about having the ability to share ones own experience of a shoot with the host club, other competitors and anyone  interested in archery generally.</p>

        <h4>Registering a venue</h4>		
		<p>Are you part of club who'd like to register their venue? Send FAF an <a href="mailto:FAFAdmin@gmail.com?subject=Register a Venue">email</a> with all of the details.</p>
